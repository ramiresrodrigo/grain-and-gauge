# Grain & Gauge 
**A Project Management Tool for Independent Contractors**

## Background
As a former finish carpenter, I experienced firsthand the difficulty of managing multiple clients, tracking material costs, and hitting deadlines while on a job site. I built **Grain & Gauge** to solve these specific pain points with a clean, mobile-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Project Dashboard:** Visual cards for tracking active jobs.
- **Financial Tracking:** Real-time calculation of total project revenue and identification of high-value contracts.
- **Persistent Storage:** Data is saved locally in the browser so it's ready when you return to the shop.
- **Live Search:** Quickly filter through clients by name to find project specs instantly.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** Custom responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Logic, DOM manipulation, and data filtering.
- **LocalStorage:** For client-side data persistence.

## 2026 Roadmap
- [ ] Migrate to **React** for better component management.
- [ ] Connect to **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) for cloud-based data syncing across devices.
- [ ] Add an image upload feature to attach "Before & After" photos to job cards.
